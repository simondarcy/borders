## Can you draw the Irish border?

Channel 4 asked the British public to draw the Norther Irish border during the UK/EU brexit talks

When the video went viral, RTÃ‰ went onto the streets of Dublin to see if the Irish public could do any better

After seeing the above 2 examples go viral I decided to throw together an interactive version to test people in the office.

This little game was a big hit in the office so the editorial team decided to publish it onto the site

I used Phaser.io as I was using it on another project at the time so knew I could prototype this quickly.
 
I didn't intend it to be published so the code pretty thrown together and inline.
